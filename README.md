> Subtly watches your webcam (with permission!), detects rising stress or eye-strain, then suggests a personalized 60-second mindful pause—optimizing break style based on your feedback.

## 🌟 Overview

BreathePulse isn't just another break timer; it's your **intelligent wellness companion** designed for the modern knowledge worker. In today's demanding digital world, fatigue, eye strain, and stress can creep up unnoticed. BreathePulse acts as a gentle, ambient guardian for your well-being.

Using cutting-edge computer vision (CV) directly in your browser, it monitors subtle cues for signs of fatigue or stress. When it senses you might need a moment, it proactively suggests a tailored microbreak – perhaps a calming breathing exercise 😮‍💨, a quick posture reset 🤸, or even a fun mini-puzzle 🧩 to refresh your focus. The more you interact, the smarter it gets, learning which breaks work best for *you*.

**Our Goal:** To seamlessly integrate mindful moments into your workday, preventing burnout and enhancing focus, all with a **privacy-first, mindful, and minimalist approach.**

## 🏗️ Architecture & Key Components

*   **`ui/src/pages/`:** Contains the main application views:
    *   `App.tsx` (Home): Likely the main dashboard, including the webcam view and status indicators.
    *   `Profile.tsx`: User settings, preferences, potentially displaying companion memory (MYA-55).
    *   `Login.tsx` / `Logout.tsx`: Standard Firebase authentication pages.
    *   Potentially pages/components for specific break types (e.g., `BreathingBreak.tsx`).
*   **`ui/src/components/`:** Reusable UI elements:
    *   `WebcamMonitor.tsx`: Component responsible for accessing and displaying the webcam feed.
    *   `BreakSuggestionModal.tsx`: Modal dialog suggesting a break.
    *   `CoachChatInterface.tsx`: UI for interacting with the AI coach.
    *   `AppProvider.tsx`: Wraps the application, providing global context/state (like theme).
    *   Shared components built with Shadcn/ui.
*   **`ui/src/utils/`:** Frontend helpers:
    *   `memoryStore.ts`: Zustand store for managing and displaying companion chat memory (MYA-55, MYA-57).
    *   Other utility functions, type definitions (`types.ts`).
*   **`src/app/apis/`:** Backend FastAPI routers:
    *   `cv_analysis/`: Endpoints like `analyze_frame` to process webcam data.
    *   `coaching/`: Endpoints like `generate_coaching_message` and `chat_with_coach` (with memory via MYA-56).
    *   `feedback/`: Endpoints like `submit_feedback` to record user responses to breaks.
*   **`src/app/auth.py` / `ui/src/app/auth/`:** Backend and frontend logic for handling Firebase authentication.
